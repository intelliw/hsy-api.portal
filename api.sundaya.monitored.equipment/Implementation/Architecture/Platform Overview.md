# Platform Overview
---

Data by itself is not inherently valuable and, in order to realise the value of the data technologies in the platform, that data needs to be organised, conditioned, processed, and analysed in order to provide insights that drive informed decisions. 

The platform focuses on producing data which is correct with respect to real-time, and delivered with extremely low latency, so that action can be taken in the moments that matter. 

Platform services share a messaging framework which standardises the way services use messaging and queuing (e.g. Kafka, NATS, PubSub).

The high level tiers are summarised below:

### Edge Data Collection 

1. **Devices** - _PMS_, _MPPT_, and _Inverters_ which continuously produce monitoring data.

2. **Device Controllers** - such as _BBC_ and _EHub Gateways_, which collect and upload data through an API.

### Data Management

3. **Trilateral API** - synchronous _Command/Query_, and asynchronous _Publish_ and _Subscribe_ API interfaces.

4. **Data Pipeline** - _Message Broker_ cluster, and real-time ingest and query _Analytics Engine_.

5. **Data Storage** - _Data Warehouse_ for SQL analytics (technical users), deep storage, view materialisation, and data retention management.

6. **Data Visualisation** - _Analytics Engine_, OLAP data store, and _BI/OI Dashboard_ for business intelligence reports and ad-hoc queries by business users.

- `BI` (_Business Intelligence_) artefacts include reports and visualisations for analyzing trends over time.

- `OI` (_Operational Intelligence_) artefacts include real-time dashboards and alerts for exceptions to provide a holistic picture of what is currently happening across the system landscape.
